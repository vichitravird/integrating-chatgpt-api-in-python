Objective:
To develop a Python-based model for automated data wrangling using Large Language Models (LLMs) and the OpenAI API. This project aims to create a user-friendly web application that allows users to upload data files, perform various data wrangling tasks such as cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL operations, joins, and generate visualizations using simple user commannds (English).

"""
Integrating the ChatGPT API into Python offers a seamless way to leverage powerful AI language capabilities within your applications. By utilizing the API, developers can effortlessly incorporate natural language processing functionalities such as text generation, completion, and understanding into their Python projects.

To integrate the ChatGPT API, developers typically follow a few straightforward steps. First, they obtain an API key from OpenAI, which grants access to the service. Then, using popular libraries like `requests` or specialized SDKs provided by OpenAI, developers can make HTTP requests to the API endpoints, passing in the text input and receiving responses in return. These responses contain the AI-generated text based on the provided input.

Python's versatility makes it an ideal choice for integrating the ChatGPT API, as developers can easily incorporate AI-powered text generation into various applications, including chatbots, content generation tools, customer support systems, and more. With the API's capabilities, developers can enhance user experiences, automate tasks, and create innovative solutions across a wide range of domains.

Title: Automated Data Wrangling Web Application with Large Language Models


Methodology:
1. **Data Input**: Users can upload data files through the web application interface.
2. **Data Storage**: Uploaded files are stored on AWS S3 Bucket using the boto3 library, ensuring secure and scalable data storage.
3. **Processing with LLMs**: Utilizing Large Language Models through the OpenAI API, the application enables users to execute data cleaning tasks, conduct EDA, perform SQL queries, execute joins, and generate graphs.
4. **Web Application Interface**: Develop a user-friendly web interface allowing seamless interaction with the application.
5. **Integration**: Integrate the data wrangling functionalities seamlessly into the web application, providing a cohesive user experience.

Conclusion:
The development of an automated data wrangling web application using Large Language Models and the OpenAI API presents a powerful solution for simplifying and streamlining the data preprocessing process. By combining the capabilities of LLMs with a user-friendly interface and seamless integration with AWS S3, this project aims to empower users with efficient, accurate, and scalable data wrangling functionalities.
